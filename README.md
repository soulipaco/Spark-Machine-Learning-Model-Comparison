Spark Machine Learning Model for Loan Data Analysis

This repository showcases my machine learning project focused on analyzing loan data to predict loan default likelihood. The project follows a structured approach to understand the financial behavior of borrowers using Spark MLlib.

Project Overview:

Executive Summary: Summarizes the project's scope and key findings.

Business Problem: Discusses the motivation behind the project, emphasizing the financial implications of predicting loan defaults.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigates numerical, categorical, and target variables to glean insights and prepare the data for modeling.

Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction:

PCA Analysis: Determines the optimal number of features.

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): Utilizes logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest to identify the most significant features.

Oversampling with SMOTE: Enhances the dataset to address class imbalance for robust model training.

Modelling Steps: Detailed steps of building and tuning models using Spark MLlib.

Model Performance Analysis: Evaluates the efficacy of different models based on various metrics.

Comments on Model Performance: Provides a critical assessment of the models, including insights and potential improvements.

The repository includes all necessary code and documentation for replicating the analysis. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in using Spark for advanced machine learning tasks but also my ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.
